# INTRODUCTION
Malnutrition is one of the prominent social issues across the globe. It is a condition that results from an inadequate or unbalanced diet, which has a significant social implication. Moreover, it can affect individuals, families, and communities, and it is often associated with broader socio-economic factors. It encompasses three primary categories of conditions: undernutrition, comprising wasting, stunting, and underweight; micronutrient-related malnutrition; and overweight, obesity, and diet-related issues. Malnutrition is a pervasive global issue, impacting individuals universally. In 2014, 462 million adults were underweight, and 1.9 billion were overweight or obese globally. Approximately 155 million children under 5 years experienced stunting, with 41 million being overweight or obese. Undernutrition is associated with 45% of deaths in children under 5 years old [1].
Moreover, the goal of this project is to predict malnutrition levels, encompassing severe wasting, wasting, overweight, stunting, and underweight through a comprehensive approach. Initial steps involve meticulous data preparation, including cleaning and preprocessing. Logistic regression is employed for binary classifications, with the dataset split into training and testing sets. For multi-class scenarios, decision trees and random forests are explored. Deep learning models using TensorFlow Keras capture intricate patterns. Performance metrics guide model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning optimizes parameters. Models are validated on new data for generalization, offering insights into malnutrition factors. The iterative process ensures continuous improvement based on feedback and new data, striving for a robust and accurate predictive model.
In the pursuit of combating malnutrition, alignment with key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is crucial. One of the primary targets of this project is to attain SDG 2: Zero Hunger, aiming to eliminate hunger, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture. Additionally, the project contributes to targeting the attainment of SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, recognizing the intrinsic link between malnutrition and overall health outcomes. Addressing this global challenge also aligns with SDG 1: No Poverty and SDG 10: Reduced Inequality, acknowledging the interconnected nature of these goals.
